I tried to build simple webpage that displays list of users

  ##The page contains the form where users can enter their name(first name and last name) and their email
  ##When the form is submitted the user added to the list that displays on the screen
  ##The user can,t submit empty forms 

  ##After the user added to list,it can also edit and delete its forms
  ##I used css to style the page and js for interactivity
  ##I tried to make the page to responsive (by using mobile first approach)
